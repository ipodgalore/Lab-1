<h1>Welcome to my first project!</h1>
  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hi my name is Simeon Wilson. I am a sophmore here at IIT majoring in Information Technology and Management.</p>
  <p>I have some coding experience in HTML5 and CSS but that was a few years ago and I hope to relearn and become proficient by taking this class. </p>
